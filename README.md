This project was developed during MHacks6 to import class schedules from Purdue's website into Google Calendar.
I developed this project because I was sick of pulling up a screenshot of my class schedule everyday just to get to my classes.

Why Purdue Cal?
- Get notifications straight to your phone when class is about to start, via the Google Calendars App
- Google Calendar Events will recur until the course is over
- Easy access to helpful information about your class
  - Official course name, CRN number and course level
  - Directions to your class (campus, building and room number) via Google Maps
  - Professor's name
  - Number of credits earned

Instructions:
- Download the PurdueCal Chrome extension, once it is installed you should now see a green download button in your browser toolbar
- Login to [MyPurdue](https://mypurdue.purdue.edu), click on the 'Academic' tab, on the left sidebar under the heading 'Schedule' click on the link 'Concise Schedule'
- Click on the PurdueCal green download button located in your browser toolbar, you will be prompted with a download
- Import the downloaded file (by default 'MyPurdueSchedule.txt') into Google Docs
- Download the PurdueCal Google Docs add-on
- Click on the 'Add-ons' menu in the imported Google Doc, hover over the PurdueCal add-on menu, click 'Export to Google Calendar'
